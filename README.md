# States Quiz

The States Quiz is a simple re-frame application that demonstrates the basics building blocks provided by re-frame. Oh, and it helps you to learn your states and capitals to boot!


## Development Mode

### Start Cider from Emacs:

Put this in your Emacs config file:

```
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl
	"(do (require 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api)
         (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/start-figwheel!)
         (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/cljs-repl))")
```

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` or (`C-c M-J`)

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

## Production Build


To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```
